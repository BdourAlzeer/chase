Firstly start the server by:
$ cd solr-6.6.0/bin
$ ./solr start -s [/home/.../chase/data/solr]


Tips for using solr server (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/Running+Solr)
- always remember TO STOP THE SERVER when you finish, by typing './solr stop -all'
- it is better to make a back up of the index. this is located in [/home/.../chase/data/solr]
- sometimes if server does not start, check if there is a 'write.lock' file within the
sub folders of [/home/.../chase/data/solr]. if so, delete them and try again
-
