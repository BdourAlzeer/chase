currently results are poor possibly because of feature selection
- fs selects features on training set, typically returns <200 features. But
it is highly likely that the test set will not contain those reduced features,
because test set is unseen

- try select more features
- try experiment on the larger dataset
- try dnn
- decide which are the different FS to use
